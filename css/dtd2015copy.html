His style ranges from the type of slide guitar pieces associated with early country blues to sophisticated, romantic R&B balladry. Englehart has had a long stretch to develop these concepts, having kept a group together under the name of Little Bill & the Blue Notes since 1956. Prior to that, it was the 1955 Tacoma Blue Notes, pinning down the exact part of Washington a bit more precisely. Younger players who have towered overLittle Bill on the bandstand include an organist, Dick Powell, who is of no relation to the movie matinee idol of old; guitarist Billy Stapleton; and drummer Bill Barner.</p>

<h4><span class="white">Jessica Lynne and the Cousins</span> | <span class="white">Country & Western, 6-9:30pm in Westlake Park</span></h4>
<p>Sometimes authentic country music artists do not grow up in what we would consider hotbeds of country music. Sometimes they grow up in Haslev, Denmark, the native town of current Seattle resident, Jessica Lynne, a sensational and rising country star and London Tone Music's latest signing.</p>
<p>Making the move from Haslev to Seattle a few years ago was actually not as strange a transition as it seems. Jessica wasted no time adjusting to both the physical landscape, which had many elements similar to Denmark, but to the musical landscape, as well. Her great songwriting and singing talent combined with her drive, focus, warmth and friendliness, made her not only an instant favorite with the country music promoters and clubs in the greater Seattle area, but also with other musicians in town. Jessica loves to write and play music so much that she is known to play almost every night of the week somewhere, sometimes as the headliner, other times as support for her many musical friends.</p>
<p>In 2011, buoyed by her belief in her original material and a successful Kickstarter campaign, Jessica released Spiritual Cowgirl, a four-song collection her growing fan base loved. She followed that up in 2013 with a single, "Mississippi in July," and an award-winning video of the song recorded at Seattle's Columbia City Theater with her band, The Cousins.</p>
<p>In February of 2014, she was chosen to fly to Nashville to audition for The Voice. Being in Nashville for the first time was something Jessica took full advantage of, soaking it all in, hearing music and feeling, as you can imagine, very much at home. As one recent review put it, "There is an undeniable purity in Lynne's vocals and a warm tone that really draws a listener into her songs. Comparisons to Trisha Yearwood and Tanya Tucker are appropriate. Featuring a vocal reminiscent of Dolly Parton, Lynne's control and tone are remarkable. Lynne puts some great energy into the vocals and the payoff is a modern country rocker that would fit well on country radio alongside Carrie Underwood or Miranda Lambert."
Don't miss this outstanding night. <a href="http://www.jessica-lynne.com" target="_blank">jessica-lynne.com</a></p>

<p><em><strong>Beginning Country Western 2-step lesson by Robb Bryan | <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Seattle-Swing-Dance-Club/248550501921" target="_blank">Seattle West Coast Swing Dancers on Facebook</a></strong></em><br>
Robb says he has had a love for music all his life, and was even working on a music major once upon a time. Later, he found another great outlet for music when he started dancing Country Western, and then West Coast Swing, in 1993. He's competed nationally in both Country and West Coast Swing and taught both in the Seattle area since the late 90′s. He started DJ-ing around 2004 and loves watching dancers respond to his music almost as much as dancing to it. Working by day as a mild-mannered IT guy, and by night as a DJ, dance instructor, and social dancer affords him little time for much else including sleep, but the love of music, dancing, and of the dancers themselves, keeps him going.</p>
<p>You'll find Robb DJ-ing WCS every other Tuesday night at the <a href="http://www.centuryballroom.com/" target="_blank">Century Ballroom</a>, teaching and DJ-ing WCS at China Harbor Restaurant on Thursday nights, teaching and DJ-ing Country Western at his own Country dances held on 2nd and 4th Friday nights at the <a href="http://www.hayloftdance.com/" target="_blank">Hayloft in Lynnwood</a>, and teaching and DJ-ing WCS at some of the 1st-&-3rd Sunday dances held by the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Seattle-Swing-Dance-Club/248550501921" target="_blank">Seattle Swing Dance Club</a>.</p>

<h4><span class="white">Valse Café Orchestra</span> | <span class="white">Waltz, Swing, Foxtrot, Polka (It's a Ball Rouge, wear something Red!), 6-9:30pm in Freeway Park</span></h4>
<p>The idea of a "café" orchestra appeared more then a hundred and fifty years ago in Imperial Vienna, and the Valse Café Orchestra has brought this good idea into the 21st Century: a small, nimble ensemble that can play like its big-cousin symphony orchestras — when it wants to — or shrink to a trio or a quartet when the mood is intimate. Performing post-modern renditions of dance-hall classics, this ensemble's repertoire celebrates a mélange of bygone eras and cultures: Paris in the thirties. Habsburg Vienna. Yiddish melancholy. Gypsy romance. Ragtime Manhattan. The milongas of Buenas Aires — all connected by the mesmerizing cadence of waltz and the exuberant syncopation of swing. Perfect for dancers and other romantics. <a href="http://www.valsecafeorchestra.com">valsecafeorchestra.com</a></p>
