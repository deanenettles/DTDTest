<h4>Kiki Valeria y su Son Cubano | Salsa<br>
Westlake Park, 6–9:30pm</h4>					
<p>Son cubano is one of the most popular musical styles in Cuba and Kiki Valera is one of its foremost exponents. Over the last century, this style of traditional Cuban music has contributed to many other genres of music including jazz, cha cha cha, mambo, salsa, songo and timba. Cuban son is the music that made the Buena Vista Social Club worldwide stars in the late 1990s but Kiki Valera comes from a family of musicians whose involvement with Cuban son pre-dates the BVSC by decades.</p>

<p>Kiki Valera is the oldest son of the famous La Familia Valera Miranda septet, a multi-generational traditional music group from Santiago de Cuba. Since the 19th century, La Familia Valera Miranda has played a significant role in Cuban culture by collecting and preserving the deep-rooted traditions of the legendary Sierra Maestra mountain region. Their debut album, ANTOLOGÍA INTEGRAL DEL SON, released in 1982, helped initiate the explosion of interest in traditional Cuban music. <a href="https://www.kikivalera.com" target="_blank">kikivalera.com</a></p>

<p>Kiki, like most of his family, is a virtuoso. A multi-instrumentalist, composer, arranger, sound engineer and producer, he’s best known as one of the world’s greatest players of the Cuban cuatro, a mid-size guitar with 8 strings grouped in sets of 2.</p>

<p>Kiki picked up the Cuban tres under the guidance of his father Felix when he was a child. He later attended one of the most prestigious music schools in Cuba, the Conservatorio Esteban Salas, in Santiago de Cuba and by age 15 was touring internationally.</p>

<p>Kiki continues to direct, compose, arrange and perform internationally. He also performs and teaches in Seattle where he contributes to the vibrant music scene of the Pacific Northwest. His current project features several other internationally acclaimed recording artists including Coco Freeman (former lead singer of Adalberto Alvarez y su Son and NG La Banda), vocalist Carlos Cascante (3x Grammy Award winning vocalist of Spanish Harlem Orchestra), trompetista Alexis Baró (Cubanismo and Omara Portuondo) and bongocero Pedro Vargas (Barbarito Torres band).</p>
                <p><em><strong>Salsa lesson by Hallie Kuperman and Cockrill | <a href="https://centuryballroom.com/" target="_blank">CenturyBallroom.com</a></strong></em><br>Hallie Kuperman is the owner of Century Ballroom and The Tin Table restaurant in Seattle. Since 1991 she has taught pretty much every form of social dance with the exception of Argentine Tango (for which you have to have prettier legs!). Currently she teaches Salsa and Waltz. She produces, co-choreographs and performs in Century's cabaret shows. </p>
<p>Since 2005 she has been the co-instructor for NW School's Social Dance Program. Since 2010 she has helped produce the "Dancing With The Stars"-style fundraiser, "Seattle Dances," for Plymouth Housing Group. She has taught at Google, Microsoft, Team Survivor Northwest, EMP, University of WA, Cornish College of the Arts, Folklife and more schools and private lessons than she can remember. </p>
<p>Hallie's passion is Century Ballroom, her students, clients of the Ballroom and The Tin Table and creating a community that people will never forget.</p>
                <p>Alison Cockrill began formal dance training at age 4, and a professional performing career in 1987. She has performed works by and toured internationally with modern dance choreographers Wade Madsen and Pat Graney. She fell in love with salsa after a trip to Guatemala in the mid-nineties and has been teaching it since 1999. One of her favorite parts of teaching is when beginning students get hooked and say what she said her first time in a salsa club, “I can’t believe this was here all this time.” She teaches Bachata and Salsa at The Century Ballroom.</p>

<h4>Louisiana Night with DJ Sean "Gatorboy" Donovan | Cajun &amp; Zydeco<br>
Ballard Commons, 6–9pm</h4>
<p>Cajun is the French country music-inspired dance music of the Cajuns (French-Canadians) who ended up in Louisiana around 1760. Their music is based on the fiddle and accordion. Cajun culture mixed with the Creole and Indian cultures that was already there, and when rock 'n' roll was added in the 1950s result was Black Creole Zydeco music &mdash; a hibrid mixing washboard, accordion and electric guitar. As Sean will show you, the result is a music that just makes you want to dance.</p>
<p><strong><em>Beginning Zydeco lesson with Sean Donovan | <a href="http://www.GatorBoyProductions.com" target="_blank">GatorBoyProductions.com</a> </em></strong><br>

</div>

<p>Seattle Gypsy Jazz band Ranger and the "Re-Arrangers" evoke the spirit of a Paris café and the raucous energy of a Gypsy campsite with their unique twist on gypsy jazz. "At the heart of their sound is Ranger Sciacca's sweet violin playin, his sense of melody and daring improvisations" (<em>World Rhythm Webzine</em>). The band's repertoire includes swing standards, traditional Gypsy melodies, the music of Django Reinhardt and Stephane Grappelli, and Ranger's unique originals. Ranger and his father Michael formed Ranger and the "Re-Arrangers" in 2006, after returning from the Django Reinhardt festival in Samois, France. In the years since, the band has released 4 CDs and played over 100 shows a year, including summer concerts, festivals, swing dances, art openings, and weddings. <a href="http://www.rangerswings.com" target="_blank">www.rangerswings.com</a></p>

He studied for the next several years, traveling to Ecuador, Mexico and all over the USA and has trained and performed with world champions, Omar Muños, Johnny Vazquez, and trained with Jonathan Ibarra, Jhon Narvarez, Adrian and Anita, Alien Ramerez and many others.

   <hr />
</div>

<h4>The Elnah Jordan Experience | Swing &amp; Blues</h4>
<h5>Ballard Commons, 6–9pm</h5>
<p>Elnah Jordan's passion for singing was discovered when she was a child in the church choir. Originally from Ohio, Elnah was influenced and encouraged by her mother who is an accomplished pianist. She developed her natural and raw talent on a path that winded through the choir stands of her gospel roots to the streets of San Francisco and its clubs and eventually with much persistence, to the theater. She was awarded a nomination in 1986 in that city for Jazz Vocalist of the Year.</p>

<p>Elnah performed in several other theatrical productions including a two and half year stint in “The Evolution of the Blues” produced by Jon Hendricks in which she portrayed the legendary Bessie Smith. Her performance in the off Broadway musical drama, "Street Dreams” landed her the prestigious Cabaret Gold Award. She has also given opening performances for artists such as Gil Scott-Heron and Bobby Blue Bland.</p>

<p>Having moved to Seattle, Elnah has been embraced by the community of gifted performers and artists here. She continues to grow in her appreciation of the music and for the blessing of being able to do what she loves dearly. She has graced stages through-out the Pacific Northwest: She been a featured performer at Egan’s Ballard Jam House, The Sorrento Hotel, Tula's Jazz Lounge, The Royal Room , Grazies and the New Orleans. She even found her way into the Seattle theater scene performing in the last season of Black Nativity.</p>
                <p><strong><em>Beginning Blues lesson with John Lozano / <a href="www.fluidandformless.com" target="_blank">www.fluidandformless.com</a></em></strong><br /> If John can learn to dance, then so can you! John began dancing around Detroit in 1997 while still in high school. He started with little skill and was regularly told “you're not actually leading me to do anything!” Luckily his love for music, interest in meeting people, and desire to figure things out drove him to keep with it. He began with East Coast Swing and Lindy Hop, and dabbled in other dances before finding Blues. He now enters his 20th year of teaching dance. He has taught throughout the U.S. and Canada, and as far away as England, Holland and Argentina. You can find him every Tuesday at Seattle's only weekly Blues dance at the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/AlibiBlues/" target="_blank">Greenwood Alibi Room</a>. </p>
